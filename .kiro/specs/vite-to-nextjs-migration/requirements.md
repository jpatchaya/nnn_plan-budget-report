# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the existing Vite + React + TypeScript project to Next.js while preserving all current functionality, components, and user experience. The project is a budget management application with multiple pages, shadcn/ui components, and modern React patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from Vite to Next.js, so that I can benefit from Next.js features like server-side rendering, better SEO, and improved performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL use Next.js App Router instead of Vite
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing pages SHALL be accessible with the same URLs
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain the same visual appearance and functionality
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the build process SHALL use Next.js build commands instead of Vite

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing pages to work exactly the same after migration, so that my workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing any existing route THEN the system SHALL display the same page content as before
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain the same routing behavior
3. WHEN using any UI components THEN they SHALL function identically to the current implementation
4. WHEN the application loads THEN all styling SHALL appear exactly as it does currently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve all existing dependencies and configurations, so that the migration doesn't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all shadcn/ui components SHALL continue to work without modification
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN TanStack Query SHALL continue to function for data fetching
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN Tailwind CSS SHALL continue to provide styling
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN TypeScript configuration SHALL be compatible with Next.js
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing utility functions and hooks SHALL work unchanged

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project structure to follow Next.js conventions, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the project SHALL use Next.js App Router file-based routing
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN pages SHALL be organized in the app directory structure
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the project SHALL have appropriate Next.js configuration files
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the project SHALL use Next.js-compatible package.json scripts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain the same development experience, so that the workflow remains familiar and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the development server THEN the system SHALL provide hot reloading
2. WHEN making changes to components THEN the system SHALL reflect changes immediately
3. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL generate optimized static assets
4. WHEN linting code THEN the system SHALL use the same ESLint configuration
5. WHEN using path aliases THEN the @ alias SHALL continue to work for src imports

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have better performance and SEO capabilities, so that it loads faster and is more discoverable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL benefit from Next.js automatic optimizations
2. WHEN pages are accessed THEN they SHALL have proper meta tags for SEO
3. WHEN images are used THEN they SHALL be optimized using Next.js Image component where appropriate
4. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL generate static pages where possible

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up Vite-specific files and configurations, so that the project doesn't have unnecessary legacy code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN Vite configuration files SHALL be removed
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the index.html file SHALL be replaced with Next.js app structure
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN Vite-specific dependencies SHALL be removed from package.json
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the main.tsx entry point SHALL be replaced with Next.js app structure
